# Html-CSS-Java-script
I Created Flipkart Application by Using Html, CSS and java script. By Using Html to Build the Basic Structure of the Home page, Than Applied CSS to design the layout, Choose Colours, set fonts and style it to look similar to the original flipkart home page .and i used java script to add smooth transition such as hover effects on product images.
